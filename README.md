APK Downloader Chrome Extension
===============================
This original version of this Chromium extension can be found on
http://codekiem.com/2012/02/24/apk-downloader/. Improvements have been made by
Bexton.

This version is based on apkdownloader-1.3.4.zip as found on
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1809458. This project was
started because the 1.3.4 version became broken with Chromium 23 and because I
(Lekensteyn) prefer a public git repository to work on code instead of some
obscure zip package from a random forum.

Contributions are always welcome.

Installation
------------
Prior to version 1.4.1, only a source distribution was available, but since I
found out that some third parties provide a CRX file with spyware, I decided to
make a CRX available as well. For installation instructions, see:

  https://lekensteyn.nl/apk-downloader/

Changelog
---------
For changes before and including 1.3.4, see
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1809458.

For a detailed changelog from 1.4 and later, see
https://lekensteyn.nl/apk-downloader/#changelog

Known issues
------------
- No useful error when a download failed (todo: decode response).
- MarketDA session cookie is not cleared when download is initiated/complete.

Credits
-------
Many thanks to [redphoenix89](http://codekiem.com/) for the original version and
[Bexton](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4273402) for the improved
version.

[Lekensteyn](http://lekensteyn.nl/) started cleaning the extension, fixing
header-related bugs and tried to make the options page more obvious. [Rob
W](http://rob.lekensteyn.nl/) rewrote the download code.

Other projects
--------------
While trying to find out how things work, I encountered some other projects:

1. Python download script
  [bluemutedwisdom/google-play-downloader][1-python]  
  Uses the same idea as redphoenix89's Chrome extension, but implemented in
  Python
2. PHP script for downloading
  [Downloading APKs from Android Market][2-php]  
  I could not test the actual APK download process as tcpdump did not show
  the necessary UserID.  
  The original author notes this method is now no longer working:  
    > Note:
    > This is a very old post and will no longer work because the Google 
    > Play API has changed significantly. This post has been left here for 
    > historical reference.
